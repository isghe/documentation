# FAQ / FYI

**What is the Infura endpoint for WebSockets?**

There is an endpoint for each supported network (Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, Kovan, GÃ¶rli); see the [Getting started guide](https://infura.io/docs/gettingStarted/chooseaNetwork) for details.

**Is batch support available?**

Yes

**Is compression enabled?**

Yes

**What is the max payload size?**

128MB

**Why does my websocket connection disconnect after a while?**

Idle connections that exceed beyond an hour will get disconnected. Adding 'pings' to your websocket connection will prevent the connection from going idle.
Any unrecognized requests will trigger the server to close the connection with an error message.

**Non-empty 'Sec-WebSocket-Protocol' header error?**

web3.js 1.0.0-beta.34 has an open issue with request headers https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/issues/1559. Please revert/downgrade to 1.0.0-beta.33.

**Why is includeTransactions option not working for eth_subscribe?**

Though the includeTransactions option is included in the Ethereum Pub/Sub API documentation, currently it is not returning the expected results.
